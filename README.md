This repository is a toy implementation of a crypto-currency system.  
Since this is a beginner project for learning and implementing various data structures, all the structures involved like BlockChain, Transaction Blocks, Transaction Queues, Merkle Trees, Tree Nodes etc, have been implemented from scratch (using basic data structures like ints, strings, arrays).
